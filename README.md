Hello,

I am a software developer always looking for new things to learn.  Mostly working on Linux with embedded systems and in the networking aspect, these days WiFi, before that lots
of protocols such as ISDN Multi-Channels PPP, SDLC, X.52, HDLC, Frame Relay, and a lot more I do not remember.

These days I am playing a lot with VSCode (not coding just using/integrating), anything Unit/Component test aspects, tools related to development, etc.

Lots of past experience in many languages (C, C++, GNU Make, Bash, asm 680x0, Rust, Dart, Perl, TypeScript, JS, HTML, CSS, Scala, Groovy, Python, ObjectiveC, Java, ReBOL, Pascal, COBOL, and some more).

Contributed in the past to:
- Kemerge (Visual tool to Gentoo emerge command-line tool)
- Mozilla (worked on porting to BeOS)

Otherwise just asking for fix, submitting bug fix, etc.

Past work:
- HPE Aruba
- Colubris Networks
- Zero-Knowlegde
- Eicon Technologies
